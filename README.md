# tecredshift
Web based EXA Punks - TEC Redshift cart conversion tool.

User the tool here: https://herebemike.github.io/tecredshift/site/

For now, this is just a simple page that allows the user to upload two PNG images - first, the source cart, second the png to load the cart into.

## Sprite Editing:

Now also has a sprite / animation editor which outputs to `DATA` formated code. There are still a few features missing that I'd like to add, I want to improve the input etc.
